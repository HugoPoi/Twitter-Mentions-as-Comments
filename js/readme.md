Javascript
==========

Your plugin's javascript files should go in the `front-end` and `admin` folders. 

Any .js file in the folder will be included automatically. Inclusion can be filter (e.g., to only include on certain pages) via filter.

Files ending in `.dev.js` will be preferred if using `WP_DEBUG` or `SCRIPT_DEBUG`.

If set, any i18n data will be stored as the plugin slug.
